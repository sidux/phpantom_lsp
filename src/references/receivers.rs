//! Resolving the receivers of a file's member accesses, and remembering
//! the answers.
//!
//! A member search has to know which class each `$x->name()` in a
//! candidate file is called on before it can tell a reference from an
//! unrelated access that shares the name.  Working that out walks the type
//! engine over the file, so the answers are recorded per file in the
//! reference index and re-read by every later search (and by the
//! reference-count lens batch); the receivers a file settles by itself
//! (`$this`, `self`, `static`, `parent`, a static access on a written
//! class name) are answered from the symbol map without opening it.
