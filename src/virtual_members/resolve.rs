// ─── Cycle breaking ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `resolve_class_fully_inner` can re-enter itself when a virtual member
// provider or interface merge resolves a class that (transitively)
// depends on the class being resolved — a genuine dependency cycle,
// e.g. two Eloquent models whose relationship providers resolve each
// other.  Eager population in toposorted order makes such re-entry rare
// (dependencies are usually already cached), but cycles broken by the
// toposort and classes loaded on demand mid-resolution can still hit
// it.  The [`ResolvedCacheInner::mark_in_flight`] set — keyed by
// `(thread, FQN)` so concurrent resolutions of the same class on other
// threads proceed independently — detects the re-entry, and the
// re-entrant call returns a base-inheritance partial result instead of
// recursing forever.

/// resolution call tree unwinds (normally or by panic).

/// Pre-populate the [`ResolvedClassCache`] from a pre-computed

///
/// Because the topological sort guarantees that all dependencies of a
/// class are processed before the class itself, each call to
/// [`resolve_class_fully_inner`] finds its parents, traits, interfaces,
/// and mixins already in the cache.  Provider callbacks (which call
/// `resolve_class_fully` for related classes) hit the cache immediately
/// instead of recursing, eliminating the unbounded mutual recursion that
/// previously caused stack overflow on large codebases.
///
/// This function should be called once after initial indexing is complete
/// (all files parsed into `uri_classes_index`) and again incrementally when files
/// change.
///
/// The list is consumed by a pool of scoped workers on
/// [`PARSE_WORKER_STACK_SIZE`](crate::PARSE_WORKER_STACK_SIZE) stacks, so
/// callers do not need to arrange either the parallelism or the stack
/// size themselves; the call blocks until the whole list is populated.
/// Workers pull indices off a shared counter, so the list is still
/// consumed dependency-first overall and a class's dependencies are
/// normally cached by the time it is claimed.  Immediate neighbours can
/// race: a worker that claims a class whose parent another worker is
/// still resolving resolves that parent itself, since the in-flight set
/// is keyed per thread.  That duplicates a bounded amount of work (under
/// 6 % of resolutions even with far more workers than are used here) and
/// leaves one of the two identical results in the cache.
