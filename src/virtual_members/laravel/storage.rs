//! Static resolution of `Storage::disk()` / `FilesystemManager::disk()` (and
//! the sibling `drive()`/`cloud()`/`build()`) return types from
//! `config/filesystems.php` and the `Storage::extend()` registrations a
//! project's service providers make.
//!
//! `FilesystemManager` declares all four as returning the
//! `Illuminate\Contracts\Filesystem\Filesystem` (or, for `cloud()`, `Cloud`)
//! contract, but every driver the framework ships builds a concrete
//! `Illuminate\Filesystem\FilesystemAdapter` (or a subclass of one). Since
//! `FilesystemAdapter` itself implements the `Cloud` contract, every built-in
//! driver's result satisfies the same concrete type regardless of which one
//! is configured. Assertion helpers (`assertExists()`, `assertMissing()`, …)
//! and adapter-only methods (`download()`, …) live only on the concrete
//! adapter, so member access on the declared contract falsely reports them as
//! missing.
//!
//! A project that calls `Storage::extend('name', …)` binds a disk to whatever
//! the registered closure builds, which need not be a `FilesystemAdapter`. So
//! the disk type is the union of what each configured disk resolves to: the
//! adapter for a driver the framework ships, and the closure's own return type
//! for one a `Storage::extend()` registration supplies. In the common case a
//! custom driver's closure returns a `FilesystemAdapter` too (it is how the
//! framework's own drivers, and every example in the Laravel documentation,
//! wrap a Flysystem adapter), so the union collapses back to the single
//! concrete type. A disk whose driver cannot be read as a single literal, or
//! whose custom driver has no discoverable registration, leaves the declared
//! contract untouched for every method.
