// ─── Thread-local chain resolution cache ────────────────────────────────────
//
// During a single diagnostic pass a file may contain many chain expressions
// that share common prefixes (e.g. `$model->where(...)` is the prefix of
// `$model->where(...)->whereNotNull(...)` which is the prefix of
// `$model->where(...)->whereNotNull(...)->orderBy(...)`, etc.).
//
// Without caching, each chain link re-resolves the entire prefix from
// scratch via recursive calls to `resolve_target_classes_expr`.  For a
// 6-link Eloquent chain this means the base variable is resolved 6 times,
// the first method call 5 times, etc. — O(depth²) total work.
//
// The chain cache stores `resolve_target_classes` results keyed by the
// raw subject text string.  It is activated per-request for all LSP
// handlers (completion, hover, definition, diagnostics, etc.) via
// [`with_chain_resolution_cache`] and consulted by
// `resolve_target_classes` before doing any work.
