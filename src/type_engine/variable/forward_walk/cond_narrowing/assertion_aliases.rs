/// Only the `&&` conjuncts that are themselves `instanceof`-style checks
/// are recorded; anything else in the expression (`$flag`, a comparison,
/// a call) contributes no assertion and is skipped, which still leaves
/// the recorded conjuncts sound for a truthy test.
///
/// A conjunct may itself be an `||` chain over one subject
/// (`$shouldCheck = $n instanceof Function_ || $n instanceof ClassMethod`),
/// which proves the subject is one of the listed classes exactly as the
/// same chain written straight into an `if` does.
