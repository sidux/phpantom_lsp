// ─── Diagnostic scope cache ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// During a diagnostic pass, `build_diagnostic_scopes` walks every
// function/method body in the file once and records a scope snapshot at
// each statement boundary.  The snapshots are stored in a thread-local
// `BTreeMap<u32, HashMap<String, Vec<ResolvedType>>>` keyed by byte
// offset.  When `resolve_variable_types` is called for a diagnostic
// member-access span, `lookup_diagnostic_scope` finds the nearest
// snapshot at-or-before the requested offset and returns the variable's
// types in O(log N) time — no backward scanning, no recursion.
//
// A member-reference search shares the cache but not the whole-file
// walk: it fills the same map through
// `build_diagnostic_scopes_for_offsets` for the bodies holding the
// accesses it asked about, and `ScopeCoverage` below records which those
// were, so a lookup elsewhere in the file is not answered from the
// nearest body the walk happened to reach.
