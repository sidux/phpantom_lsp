//! CLI analysis mode.
//!
//! Scans PHP files in a project and reports PHPantom's own diagnostics
//! (no PHPStan, no external tools) in a PHPStan-like table format.
//!
//! # Philosophy
//!
//! The goal is **100% type coverage**: every class, member, and function
//! call in the project should be resolvable by the LSP.  When that holds,
//! completion works everywhere with no dead spots, and downstream tools
//! like PHPStan get the type information they need to find real bugs at
//! every level.  PHPStan only complains about missing types at levels 6,
//! 9, and 10; PHPantom fills those gaps cheaply and immediately so
//! PHPStan can focus on logic errors rather than fighting incomplete
//! type information.
//!
//! The diagnostics reported here are not trying to be a static analyser.
//! They assert structural correctness: does this class exist, does this
//! member exist, does the argument count match, did you implement every
//! required method.  Bug hunting is left to dedicated tools like PHPStan
//! and Psalm.  The `analyze` command surfaces the places where the LSP
//! cannot resolve a symbol so the user can fix them and achieve (or
//! maintain) full completion coverage across the project.
//!
//! It reuses the same `Backend` initialization pipeline as the LSP
//! server, so the results match exactly what a user would see in their
//! editor.
//!
//! Composer projects (root `composer.json`) use their autoload
//! configuration for file discovery; a plain PHP tree without one is
//! analysed by scanning and walking the workspace root.  Multi-project
//! monorepos are not supported.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! ```sh
//! phpantom_lsp analyze                     # scan entire project
//! phpantom_lsp analyze src/                # scan a subdirectory
//! phpantom_lsp analyze src/Foo.php         # scan a single file
//! ```
//!
//! The driver and file discovery live in [`run`]; output formatting
//! (table, GitHub annotations, JSON) lives in [`output`].
