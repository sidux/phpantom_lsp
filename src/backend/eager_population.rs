//! Eager cache population for the LSP server.
//!
//! Two passes run once the workspace is fully indexed, both so that the
//! first interactive request reads an answer instead of computing one:
//!
//! - Every known class is resolved in dependency-first order, mirroring
//!   the CLI analyse pipeline, so completion, hover, diagnostics, and
//!   go-to-definition read pre-resolved metadata from the cache instead
//!   of recursing into class resolution.
//! - Every user file's member accesses have their receiver resolved, so
//!   the first Find References or reference CodeLens of the session
//!   answers from the recorded receivers instead of walking each
//!   candidate file with the type engine.
//!
//! Incremental re-population on file change is handled separately:
//! `parser/ast_update.rs` re-resolves only the classes an edit evicted,
//! and the receiver entries an edit can have changed are dropped by the
//! dependency-keyed retention in `reference_index.rs`.
