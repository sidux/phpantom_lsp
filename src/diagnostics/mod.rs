//! Diagnostics — collect and deliver LSP diagnostics for PHP files.
//!
//! This module collects diagnostics from multiple providers and delivers
//! them to the editor.
//!
//! ## Diagnostic code naming convention
//!
//! Every diagnostic has a `code` string that identifies the rule. When adding
//! a new diagnostic, follow these rules:
//!
//! 1. **All `snake_case`, no dots or other separators.**
//! 2. **Codes read as noun phrases describing the problem**, not bare
//!    categories. Prefer `argument_count_mismatch` over `argument_count`.
//! 3. **`unknown_*`** — symbol could not be resolved (class, function,
//!    member, variable).
//! 4. **`unused_*`** — symbol is defined/imported but never referenced.
//! 5. **`type_mismatch_*`** — a value's type doesn't satisfy a constraint
//!    (`type_mismatch_argument`, `type_mismatch_return`,
//!    `type_mismatch_property`).
//! 6. **`missing_*`** — a required declaration is absent (e.g.
//!    `missing_implementation` for unimplemented interface methods).
//! 7. **`invalid_*`** — a structural/syntactic violation (e.g.
//!    `invalid_class_kind`).
//! 8. **`deprecated_usage`** — usage of a deprecated symbol.
//! 9. **`syntax_error`** — parser-level errors.
//! 10. **`unresolved_*`** — the analyser couldn't determine the type of an
//!     expression (opt-in coverage hints).
//!
//! Two native delivery models are supported:
//!
//! - **Pull model** (`textDocument/diagnostic`, LSP 3.17) — the editor
//!   requests diagnostics when it needs them.  Only visible files are
//!   diagnosed.  Cross-file invalidation uses `workspace/diagnostic/refresh`.
//!   This is the preferred model when the client supports it.
//!
//! - **Push model** (`textDocument/publishDiagnostics`) — the server
//!   pushes diagnostics after every edit.  Used as a fallback for clients
//!   that do not advertise pull-diagnostic support.
//!
//! Native diagnostics are intentionally sent through exactly one of these
//! channels per client.  When pull is available, PHPantom uses pull only;
//! push is reserved for clients that do not support pull.  Mixing both for
//! the same native diagnostics makes client-side merge behavior ambiguous and
//! can surface duplicates or flicker.
//!
//! Providers are grouped into three phases so that cheap results appear
//! immediately and expensive external tools never block native feedback:
//!
//! ## Phase 1 — fast (no type resolution)
//!
//! - **Syntax error diagnostics** — surface parse errors from the Mago
//!   parser as Error-severity diagnostics.  The most fundamental
//!   diagnostic: without it, a user with a typo gets no feedback until
//!   they try to run the code.
//! - **Unused `use` dimming** — dim `use` declarations that are not
//!   referenced anywhere in the file with `DiagnosticTag::Unnecessary`.
//! - **Unused variable diagnostics** — dim variables that are assigned
//!   or bound as a parameter but never read in the same scope.
//! - **Namespace mismatch diagnostics** — report a single-class file
//!   whose declared namespace disagrees with the PSR-4 mapping derived
//!   from its path.
//! - **Class name mismatch diagnostics** — report a single-class file
//!   whose class name disagrees with the name PSR-4 expects for its path.
//!
//! ## Phase 2 — slow (require type resolution)
//!
//! - **Unknown class diagnostics** — report `ClassReference` spans that
//!   cannot be resolved through any resolution phase (use-map, local
//!   classes, same-namespace, fqn_uri_index, PSR-4, stubs).
//! - **Unknown member diagnostics** — report `MemberAccess` spans where
//!   the member does not exist on the resolved class after full
//!   resolution (inheritance + virtual member providers).  Suppressed
//!   when the class has `__call` / `__callStatic` / `__get` magic methods.
//! - **Unknown function diagnostics** — report function calls that
//!   cannot be resolved to any known function definition.
//! - **Undefined variable diagnostics** — report variable reads that
//!   have no prior definition (assignment, parameter, foreach binding,
//!   catch variable, `global`, `static`, `use()` clause, or `list()`
//!   destructuring) in the same scope.  Uses a conservative Phase 1
//!   approach: any assignment anywhere in the function counts as a
//!   definition.  Suppressed for superglobals, `isset()` / `empty()`
//!   guards, `compact()` references, `extract()` calls, variable
//!   variables (`$$`), `@` error suppression, and `@var` annotations.
//! - **Unresolved member access diagnostics** (opt-in) — report
//!   `MemberAccess` spans where the **subject type** cannot be resolved
//!   at all.  Off by default; enable via `[diagnostics]
//!   unresolved-member-access = true` in `.phpantom.toml`.  Uses
//!   `Severity::HINT` to surface type-coverage gaps without drowning
//!   the editor in warnings.
//! - **Argument count diagnostics** — report calls where the number of
//!   arguments does not match the function/method signature.
//! - **Implementation error diagnostics** — report concrete classes that
//!   fail to implement all required methods from their interfaces or
//!   abstract parents.  Reuses the same missing-method detection as the
//!   "Implement missing methods" code action.
//! - **`@deprecated` usage diagnostics** — report references to symbols
//!   marked `@deprecated` with `DiagnosticTag::Deprecated` (renders as
//!   strikethrough in most editors).  Requires resolving the reference
//!   to its declaration, so this runs here rather than in Phase 1.
//! - **Class case mismatch diagnostics** — report a class reference
//!   whose spelling differs only in case from its PSR-4 declaration,
//!   which loads fine on case-insensitive filesystems but fatals on
//!   Linux.
//! - **Type mismatch diagnostics** — report argument, return, and
//!   property-assignment values whose type does not satisfy the
//!   declared/inferred type.
//! - **Readonly write diagnostics** — report writes to a `readonly`
//!   property from outside the class that declares it, and second
//!   writes from inside it once the constructor has initialized the
//!   property.
//! - **Invalid class kind diagnostics** — report a class-like name used
//!   in a syntactic position (`new`, `implements`, `instanceof`, …) that
//!   its kind (class/interface/trait/enum) cannot satisfy.
//! - **Laravel string key / command parameter diagnostics** (Laravel
//!   projects only) — report route/config/view/translation/command
//!   names and morph aliases that don't resolve to a known declaration,
//!   and `$this->argument()` / `$this->option()` calls that aren't in
//!   the enclosing command's `$signature`.
//!
//! ## Phase 3 — heavy (external process, dedicated workers)
//!
//! - **PHPStan proxy diagnostics** — run PHPStan in editor mode
//!   (`--tmp-file` / `--instead-of`) and surface its errors as LSP
//!   diagnostics.  Auto-detected via `vendor/bin/phpstan` or `$PATH`;
//!   configurable in `.phpantom.toml` under `[phpstan]`.
//!
//!   PHPStan runs in a **dedicated worker task**, separate from the
//!   main diagnostic worker, because it is extremely slow and
//!   resource-intensive.  At most one PHPStan process runs at a time.
//!   If edits arrive while PHPStan is running, the pending URI is
//!   updated and the worker picks it up after the current run finishes.
//!   Native diagnostics (phases 1 and 2) are never blocked.
//!
//! - **PHPCS proxy diagnostics** — run PHP_CodeSniffer via
//!   `phpcs --report=json` and surface coding standard violations as
//!   LSP diagnostics.  Auto-detected via `vendor/bin/phpcs` or `$PATH`,
//!   independent of what `composer.json` declares; configurable under
//!   `[phpcs]`.
//!
//!   PHPCS runs in its own **dedicated worker task**, following the
//!   same pattern as the PHPStan worker.  At most one PHPCS process
//!   runs at a time, with the same debounce and pending-URI slot
//!   design.
//!
//! - **Mago lint proxy diagnostics** — run `mago lint --reporting-format
//!   json --stdin-input` and surface AST-level lint issues (style,
//!   naming, code smells) as LSP diagnostics.  Auto-detected when
//!   `mago.toml` exists at the workspace root and `vendor/bin/mago` or
//!   `mago` on `$PATH` is available; configurable under `[mago]`.
//!
//!   Mago lint runs in its own **dedicated worker task**, following the
//!   same pattern as the PHPCS worker.  Source: `"mago-lint"`.
//!
//! - **Mago analyze proxy diagnostics** — run `mago analyze
//!   --reporting-format json --stdin-input` and surface type-aware
//!   analysis issues (type mismatches, unreachable code, unused
//!   definitions) as LSP diagnostics.  Same auto-detection as Mago lint.
//!
//!   Mago analyze runs in its own **dedicated worker task**, following
//!   the same pattern as the PHPStan worker.  Source: `"mago-analyze"`.
//!
//! ## Publishing strategy
//!
//! Each diagnostic source has its own per-URI cache:
//!
//! | Cache                    | Source             |
//! | ------------------------ | ------------------ |
//! | `diag_last_fast`           | Phase 1 (fast)     |
//! | `diag_last_slow`           | type resolution    |
//! | `phpstan_tool.last_diags`  | PHPStan            |
//! | `phpcs_tool.last_diags`    | PHPCS              |
//! | `mago_lint_tool.last_diags`| Mago lint          |
//! | `mago_analyze_tool.last_diags` | Mago analyze  |
//!
//! When any source finishes, [`Backend::assemble_and_push`] reads all
//! per-source caches for the URI, merges them into a single set,
//! deduplicates, and filters suppressions.
//!
//! **Push mode:** The merged set is published via
//! `textDocument/publishDiagnostics`.  As each source finishes, its
//! cache is updated and the full assembled set is pushed.  The user
//! sees results incrementally: fast diagnostics first, then slow,
//! then PHPStan/PHPCS/Mago as each completes.
//!
//! **Pull mode:** Nothing is pushed via `publishDiagnostics`.  The
//! merged set is cached in `diag_last_full` with a bumped `resultId`
//! and the editor is asked to re-pull via `workspace/diagnostic/refresh`.
//! A source run that reproduces the cached set exactly leaves both the
//! cache and the `resultId` alone and sends no refresh: LSP has no
//! per-document refresh, so each one costs a workspace-wide re-pull and
//! is worth sending only for a real change.
//! The pull handler (`textDocument/diagnostic`) returns this cached set.
//! If the cache is missing (e.g. the file was just opened), the pull
//! handler schedules a background computation and returns whatever is
//! cached right now — usually empty — instead of computing inline: a
//! synchronous compute on the request path can wedge the transport
//! under a typing burst (see [`trigger_diagnostics_for_pull`]). The
//! worker's completion then bumps the `resultId` and requests a
//! `workspace/diagnostic/refresh`, so the editor re-pulls with the real
//! results a moment later.  A pull-capable client already has a
//! canonical native diagnostic stream, so pushing the same native
//! diagnostics as well would create two competing streams that clients
//! may merge differently.
//!
//! External tool workers (PHPStan, PHPCS, Mago) use their own
//! debounce timers in both modes because they are expensive.
//!
//! ## Files that are not open
//!
//! Everything above covers the files the user has open.  Diagnostics
//! for the rest of the workspace are computed by a separate background
//! pass described in [`workspace`].
