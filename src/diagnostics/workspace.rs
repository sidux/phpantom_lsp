//! Background workspace-wide diagnostics.
//!
//! After the initial startup indexing and the full background index
//! finish, PHPantom computes diagnostics for every user file in the
//! workspace — not just the files open in the editor — so project-wide
//! problems appear in the editor's problems panel.
//!
//! ## Ordering guarantees
//!
//! Nothing here runs before the server is usable.  The pass is chained
//! onto the end of the full background index task, which itself only
//! starts after the synchronous startup indexing in `initialized`
//! completes.  The pass additionally waits for `init_complete` so the
//! post-index cache clears in `initialized` cannot race with it.
//!
//! For pull-diagnostics clients the pass is additionally deferred until
//! the first `workspace/diagnostic` request arrives: its results are
//! only deliverable through workspace pull responses, so a client that
//! never pulls never pays for the scan.  Push clients get the pass
//! unconditionally since their results are published directly.
//!
//! 1. **Native pass** — the same fast + slow collectors that diagnose
//!    open files run over every unopened user file, on a throttled
//!    worker pool (half the cores) so interactive requests stay
//!    responsive.  Results stream to the editor as files finish.  A
//!    file whose analysis never returns is given up on and reported
//!    rather than stalling every file queued behind it, and the worker
//!    it wedged is replaced so the pool keeps its throughput; the pass
//!    is driven by `drive_native_pass`, which is where that happens.
//! 2. **External tools** — after the native pass, each configured
//!    external tool (PHPStan, PHPCS, Mago lint/analyze) runs once over
//!    the whole project.  A tool only runs when it is enabled,
//!    resolvable, and has its own project-level configuration file
//!    (`phpstan.neon`, `phpcs.xml`, `mago.toml`) so the tool itself
//!    decides which paths to analyse.  Tools run sequentially to avoid
//!    saturating the machine.
//!
//! ## Delivery
//!
//! Results for unopened files are stored in [`WorkspaceDiagnostics`]
//! and delivered through the `workspace/diagnostic` pull handler
//! (advertised via the `workspace_diagnostics` server capability) or
//! published directly via `textDocument/publishDiagnostics` for push
//! clients.  Open files are skipped: they are owned by the live
//! per-file pipeline.  When a file closes, its native diagnostics are
//! recomputed from disk and its external per-source results migrate
//! here so closed files keep accurate diagnostics.
