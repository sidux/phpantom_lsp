//! Access checks for `private` and `protected` class members.
//!
//! A member that exists is not automatically a member you may touch.
//! PHP resolves `$obj->name` to a declaration first and enforces the
//! declaration's visibility second, so a private property reached from
//! outside its class is a fatal `Error` at runtime:
//!
//! ```php
//! class Account {
//!     private string $pin = '0000';
//! }
//!
//! $account = new Account();
//! echo $account->pin; // Cannot access private property Account::$pin
//! ```
//!
//! The check runs inside the unknown-member pass rather than in a pass
//! of its own: that walk has already resolved the subject expression to
//! a class, which is the expensive half of the work.
//!
//! ## Where the effective member comes from
//!
//! The visibility that counts is the one the member has *after* the
//! class is assembled, not the one the original declaration was written
//! with.  A trait `use` clause can rewrite it — `use T { run as private; }`
//! makes a public trait method private in its host, an alias gives one
//! method two visibilities, and `insteadof` decides which of two
//! competing declarations survives at all.  The inheritance merge in
//! [`crate::inheritance`] already applies every one of those rules, so
//! this check reads the merged class and inherits that correctness
//! rather than re-deriving it.
//!
//! ## Why the merged class is not enough on its own
//!
//! The merged class records what a class *has*.  It does not record who
//! declared it, and the two come apart further than they look: the merge
//! folds an *ancestor's* traits straight into the descendant, so even a
//! private member sitting on the merged class may have been written in a
//! trait a parent uses.  Reasoning backwards from "the member is on this
//! class, so it belongs to this class" is therefore wrong, and wrong in
//! both directions — it lets a scope in that should be kept out and
//! keeps one out that PHP lets in.
//!
//! So the declaring class is *computed*, by [`declaring_class`], and
//! only when it is actually needed.  It is not needed for a public
//! member, and not for any member reached from outside every class:
//! there no scope could qualify, whoever wrote the declaration.  What is
//! left — a non-public member reached from inside some class — is the
//! rare case that pays for a walk over the raw hierarchy.
//!
//! ## What that buys on the hot path
//!
//! A public member, which is the overwhelming majority of accesses, is
//! answered by the merged lookup the surrounding pass has already paid
//! for, with no hierarchy walk at all.
//!
//! ## Silence is the default
//!
//! Nothing is reported unless a declaration is positively found and
//! positively out of reach.  An ancestor the loader cannot produce, a
//! provenance walk that comes up empty, a virtual member, a trait body
//! whose host class is unknown, a trait as the subject, and a union with
//! one branch that permits the access all end in `None`.
//!
//! One promise this module cannot make is silence over a union whose
//! branches did not all resolve: the resolver hands over the branches it
//! could load and drops the rest, so a branch that names an unindexed
//! class is not visible here at all.
