//! Unknown member access diagnostics.
//!
//! Walk the precomputed [`SymbolMap`] for a file and flag every
//! `MemberAccess` span where the member does not exist on the resolved
//! class after full resolution (inheritance + virtual member providers).
//!
//! Diagnostics use `Severity::Warning` because the code may still run
//! (e.g. via `__call` / `__get` magic methods that we cannot see), but
//! the user benefits from knowing that PHPantom can't resolve the member.
//!
//! We suppress diagnostics when:
//!
//! - The subject type cannot be resolved (we can't know what members it has).
//! - Any resolved class in a union type has the member (the member is
//!   valid for at least one branch of the union).
//! - Any resolved class has `__call` / `__callStatic` (for method calls)
//!   or `__get` (for property access) magic methods — these accept
//!   arbitrary member names at runtime.
//! - Any resolved class is `stdClass` — it is a universal object
//!   container that accepts arbitrary properties at runtime.
//! - The member name is `class` (the magic `::class` constant).
//! - The subject is an enum and the member is a case name (enum cases
//!   are accessed via `::` but stored as constants).
//! - The subject is `$this`, `self`, `static`, or `parent` inside a
//!   trait method.  Traits are incomplete by nature — they expect to
//!   be mixed into classes that provide the missing members.  Flagging
//!   accesses that only exist on host classes produces a high rate of
//!   false positives.
//!
//! ## Performance: subject resolution cache
//!
//! A single file can contain hundreds of member access spans that share
//! the same subject text (e.g. 60 occurrences of `$this->assertEquals`,
//! `$this->assertTrue`, etc.).  Without caching, each span triggers the
//! full resolution pipeline including `resolve_variable_types` which
//! re-parses the entire file via `with_parsed_program`.
//!
//! To avoid this, we cache the resolution outcome per
//! [`SubjectCacheKey`], the shared key that scopes a subject resolution
//! to one function/method/closure body.  The cache lives for a single
//! `collect_unknown_member_diagnostics` call and is not shared across
//! files or invocations.
//!
//! ## Performance: narrowing re-resolution fallback
//!
//! The cache key intentionally omits per-access byte offsets to keep
//! the cache effective.  A large service file with 200 accesses to
//! `$model->` should resolve the variable type ONCE, not 200 times.
//!
//! Expression-level narrowing (ternary `instanceof`, inline `&&`
//! chains) can change a variable's type at a specific byte offset
//! without creating a narrowing block.  To handle this without
//! busting the cache, we use a two-phase approach:
//!
//! 1. **Coarse resolution** (cached): resolve the subject WITHOUT
//!    per-access discrimination.  If the member exists on the
//!    resolved classes, we're done — no diagnostic, no re-resolution.
//!
//! 2. **Narrowing fallback** (uncached, rare): when the member is
//!    NOT found on the coarsely-resolved classes, re-resolve the
//!    subject with the exact cursor position.  If the re-resolution
//!    finds the member (because ternary/`&&` narrowing refined the
//!    type), suppress the diagnostic.
//!
//! This makes the common case (member exists) O(1) per unique
//! subject+scope, while preserving correctness for the rare case
//! where expression-level narrowing matters.  The re-resolution runs
//! only where a diagnostic would otherwise be reported, so a file
//! with nothing wrong in it never pays for it.
