/// Cross-file class and function resolution.
///
/// This module contains the heavyweight name-resolution logic that is
/// shared by the completion handler, definition resolver, and
/// named-argument resolution.  It was extracted from `util.rs` so that
/// module can focus on simple helper functions.
///
/// # Resolution pipeline
///
/// ## Class resolution ([`Backend::find_or_load_class`])
///
///   0. **Class index** — direct FQN → URI lookup (covers non-PSR-4 classes
///      and Composer classmap entries)
///   1. **uri_classes_index scan** — search all already-parsed files by short name,
///      with namespace verification when a qualified name is requested
///   2. **PSR-4 resolution** — convert namespace to file path and parse
///   3. **Embedded stubs** — built-in PHP classes/interfaces bundled in
///      the binary (e.g. `UnitEnum`, `BackedEnum`, `Iterator`)
///
/// ## Function resolution ([`Backend::find_or_load_function`])
///
///   1. **global_functions** — user code + already-cached stubs
///   2. **Embedded stubs** — built-in PHP functions from phpstorm-stubs
///
/// ## Name resolution ([`Backend::resolve_class_name`], [`Backend::resolve_function_name`])
///
///   These methods take a raw name as it appears in source code and resolve
///   it to a concrete `ClassInfo` or `FunctionInfo` using the file's `use`
///   statement mappings and namespace context.  They handle:
///
///   - Fully-qualified names (`\PDO`, `\Couchbase\Cluster`)
///   - Unqualified names resolved via the import table or current namespace
///   - Qualified names with alias expansion and namespace prefixing
