//! Whether a template's block directives pair up.
//!
//! Blade compiles every directive independently by name: `@foreach` becomes
//! a `foreach (…):` and `@endif` an `endif;`, with nothing checking that the
//! two belong together. A template that closes a loop with the wrong
//! directive therefore compiles without complaint and fails at render time,
//! with the error pointing at the compiled cache file rather than at the
//! template. The same goes for a block nobody closes.
//!
//! This scan reads the raw Blade source (not the virtual PHP the
//! preprocessor emits) and walks the directive stream with a stack of open
//! blocks. The regions Blade itself excludes from directive processing —
//! comments, `@verbatim`, and `@php` blocks — are masked out first by
//! [`super::signature::inert_regions`], the same scan the `@props` and
//! component-tag readers use, so an `@endif` written in prose or in PHP
//! code opens and closes nothing here either.
