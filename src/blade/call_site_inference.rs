//! Call-site variable inference for Blade templates.
//!
//! For templates without a declared signature (`@bladestan-signature`
//! or plain `@var` docblocks), infer the variables a template receives
//! from the call sites that reference it: `view()`/`View::make()` calls
//! (literal array keys, `compact()` arguments, `->with()` chains — see
//! [`extract_call_site_vars`]), the `@include`/`@each` family in the
//! templates that render it, and, for a component, the attributes each
//! `<x-…>` tag passes (see [`super::component_tags`]). The inferred set
//! is injected into the template's virtual-PHP prologue as `@var`
//! docblock declarations (see `preprocess_with_vars`), so every
//! consumer — completion, hover, go-to-definition, and the
//! undefined-variable diagnostic — sees them through the ordinary
//! resolution pipeline.
//!
//! This is deliberately the lowest-priority source: an in-template
//! `@var` annotation shadows an injected one (it sits closer to every
//! use site in the backward docblock scan), `@props`/`@aware`, a
//! component's backing class (see `super::backing_class`), and a
//! provider's shared and composed data (see `super::shared_vars`) win
//! over it per name, and templates that declare a signature are skipped
//! entirely. Types are "true for the callers we found": multiple call
//! sites union per variable, and dynamic view names contribute nothing.
