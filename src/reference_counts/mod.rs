//! Cached exact member references for declaration annotations.
//!
//! A count shown next to a declaration has to mean "references to *this*
//! symbol", which is the search Find References runs: resolve the receiver
//! of every candidate access and keep the ones whose type is in the
//! declaring class' hierarchy.  That search is far too slow for the CodeLens
//! request path (hundreds of milliseconds for one member on a large
//! project), so exact locations are computed on a background thread and
//! served from this bounded cache; the lens titles its count from them and
//! hands them straight to the client when the user opens the reference list.
//!
//! Clickable lenses require fresh locations, so a lens whose result is
//! being recomputed carries a placeholder rather than a count it cannot
//! back up.  The reference index marks entries stale rather than dropping
//! them, and the next lens request queues them.
//!
//! Staleness records *which files* an edit reparsed, because that is what
//! makes recomputation affordable: the accesses in those files are searched
//! for again and every other file's cached locations are merged back in, so
//! typing in one file does not re-search the workspace once per declaration
//! in it.  Only a change that can move a receiver's type anywhere (a
//! signature, a docblock, an inheritance edit) falls back to searching
//! everything.
