//! Cached exact member references for declaration annotations.
//!
//! A count shown next to a declaration has to mean "references to *this*
//! symbol", which is the search Find References runs: resolve the receiver
//! of every candidate access and keep the ones whose type is in the
//! declaring class' hierarchy.  That search is far too slow for the
//! inlay-hint and CodeLens request paths (hundreds of milliseconds for one
//! member on a large project), so exact locations are computed on a background
//! thread and served from this bounded cache.  Inlay hints read their count;
//! CodeLens reuses the locations when the user opens the reference list.
//!
//! A hint is emitted only for a member whose count is already cached, and
//! a cached value keeps being served once it goes stale so the annotation
//! does not blink out between edits.  Clickable lenses require fresh locations
//! and are omitted for refresh-capable clients until recomputation finishes.
//! The reference index marks entries stale rather than dropping them, and the
//! next annotation request queues them for recomputation.
