//! Fast byte-level PHP symbol scanners for early-stage file discovery.
//!
//! This module provides two single-pass state machines that extract
//! symbol names from PHP source without a full AST parse:
//!
//! - **PSR-4 scanner** ([`find_classes`]) — extracts fully-qualified
//!   class, interface, trait, and enum names.  Used by the PSR-4
//!   directory walker to build a classmap when Composer's
//!   `autoload_classmap.php` is missing or incomplete.
//!
//! - **Full-scan** ([`find_symbols`]) — extracts classes *plus*
//!   standalone function names, `define()` constants, and top-level
//!   `const` declarations.  Used for non-Composer projects (no
//!   `composer.json`) and for Composer autoload files
//!   (`autoload_files.php` and their `require_once` chains) to
//!   populate name-to-path indices without a full AST parse.
//!
//! These scanners serve three indexing scenarios:
//!
//! 1. **Optimized Composer** — the Composer classmap is parsed
//!    directly (not by this module).  Functions and constants from
//!    `autoload_files.php` are discovered by the full-scan during
//!    initialization, populating `autoload_function_index`,
//!    `autoload_constant_index`, and `fqn_uri_index`.  Lazy
//!    `update_ast` on first access provides complete details.
//!
//! 2. **Composer self-scan** — the PSR-4 scanner builds a classmap
//!    from `composer.json`'s autoload directories.  Functions and
//!    constants from `autoload_files.php` are discovered by the
//!    full-scan, same as scenario 1.
//!
//! 3. **No Composer** — the full-scan walks all workspace files,
//!    populating the classmap, `autoload_function_index`, and
//!    `autoload_constant_index` in one pass.  Lazy `update_ast`
//!    on first access provides complete `FunctionInfo`/`DefineInfo`.
//!
//! The implementation is modelled after Composer's `PhpFileParser` /
//! `PhpFileCleaner` pipeline and Libretto's `FastScanner`.  Both
//! scanners handle:
//!
//! - `class`, `interface`, `trait`, and `enum` declarations
//! - `namespace` declarations (including braced and semicolon forms)
//! - Single-quoted and double-quoted strings (with escape handling)
//! - Heredoc and nowdoc literals
//! - Line comments (`//`, `#`) and block comments (`/* ... */`)
//! - PHP attributes (`#[...]`) — not confused with `#` comments
//! - Property/nullsafe access like `$node->class` (not treated as a
//!   class declaration)
//! - `SomeClass::class` constant access (not treated as a declaration)
//!
//! The full-scan additionally handles:
//!
//! - `function` declarations (top-level only, not methods or closures)
//! - `define('NAME', ...)` calls (constant name from first string arg)
//! - `const NAME = ...` at top level (not class constants)
//!
//! # Performance
//!
//! Both scanners use `memchr` for SIMD-accelerated keyword
//! pre-screening.  Files that contain none of the relevant keywords
//! are rejected in a single fast pass without entering the state
//! machine.
//!
//! # Module layout
//!
//! - [`lexer`] — the SIMD byte-lexer fast path ([`find_classes`],
//!   [`find_symbols`], and the state-machine helpers they share).
//! - [`discovery`] — directory walking, PSR-4/vendor package
//!   discovery, and parallel batch scanning built on top of the
//!   lexer.
