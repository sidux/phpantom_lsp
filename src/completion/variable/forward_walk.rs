/// Forward-walking scope model for variable type resolution.
///
/// This module implements a single top-to-bottom pass through a function
/// or method body, maintaining a mutable type map (`ScopeState`) that
/// records each variable's type as assignments are encountered.  When the
/// walk reaches the cursor position it stops and the caller reads the
/// target variable's type from the map — an O(1) `HashMap` lookup with
/// zero recursion.
///
/// # Architecture
///
/// The old backward scanner (now removed) resolved one variable at a
/// time by walking backward from the cursor, recursively calling itself
/// for each RHS variable reference.  That caused O(depth × file_size)
/// work per variable lookup.
///
/// This forward walker replaces that recursion with a single forward pass:
///
/// 1. Seed `ScopeState` with parameter types.
/// 2. Walk statements top-to-bottom.  At each assignment `$a = expr`,
///    evaluate `expr` by reading other variables from the scope (O(1)
///    map lookups) and store the result under `$a`.
/// 3. At the cursor, read the target variable from the scope.
///
/// There is no recursion on variable resolution, no depth limit, and
/// every variable resolved during the walk is available to subsequent
/// statements for free.
///
/// # Phases
///
/// - **Phase 1** (completion): wired into the completion path.  The
///   forward walker is called per-request with `cursor_offset` set to
///   the cursor position.  Only the target variable's type is read.
/// - **Phase 2** (diagnostics): [`build_diagnostic_scopes`] walks every
///   function/method body in the file once (`cursor_offset = u32::MAX`)
///   and records scope snapshots at each statement boundary in a
///   thread-local [`DIAGNOSTIC_SCOPE`] cache.  When
///   `resolve_variable_types` is called for a diagnostic span, it
///   checks the cache first via [`lookup_diagnostic_scope`] and returns
///   the pre-computed types in O(log N) time, eliminating the
///   O(N x depth x file_size) cost of per-span backward scanning.

// ─── Hover scope cache (Phase 3) ────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// When multiple hover requests arrive for the same file content (e.g. a
// test file with 80+ `assertType()` calls), each request would otherwise
// trigger a full forward walk of the method body from statement 1 to the
// cursor position.  That produces O(n²) total work.
//
// The hover scope cache amortises this to O(n) per method body: the first
// hover that hits a given method walks the **full** body once (cursor at
// u32::MAX) and stores the resulting `ScopeSnapshotMap`.  Subsequent
// hovers on the same file content look up the pre-computed snapshots in
// O(log N) time via a `BTreeMap::range` search — no re-walk at all.
//
// Cache invalidation: the key is a 64-bit FNV-1a hash of the full content
// string.  This is robust against memory reuse (two different test contents
// that happen to land at the same address would produce different hashes),
// while remaining cheap to compute (single pass, no allocation).
//
// The hover cache must not interfere with the diagnostic scope cache:
// - It is only consulted / populated when `is_diagnostic_scope_active()`
//   returns `false`.
// - `build_diagnostic_scopes` never touches `HOVER_SCOPE_CACHE`.
