//! PHPantom — a fast, lightweight PHP language server.
//!
//! Diagnostics are debounced: each `did_change` bumps a per-file version
//! counter and spawns a delayed task. The task only publishes if its
//! version still matches (i.e. no newer edit arrived in the meantime).
//!
//! This crate is organised into the following modules:
//!
//! - [`types`] — Data structures for extracted PHP information (classes, methods, functions, etc.)
//! - `parser` — PHP parsing and AST extraction using mago_syntax
//! - [`completion`] — Completion logic (target extraction, type resolution, item building,
//!   and the top-level completion request handler)
//! - [`composer`] — Composer autoload (PSR-4, classmap) parsing and class-to-file resolution
//! - `server` — The LSP `LanguageServer` trait implementation (thin wrapper that delegates
//!   to feature-specific modules)
//! - `util` — Utility helpers (position conversion, class lookup, logging)
//! - `hover` — Hover support (`textDocument/hover`). Resolves the symbol under the
//!   cursor and returns type information, method signatures, and docblock descriptions
//! - `signature_help` — Signature help (`textDocument/signatureHelp`). Shows parameter
//!   hints while typing function/method arguments, with active-parameter tracking
//! - `definition` — Go-to-definition support for classes, members, and functions
//! - `inheritance` — Base class inheritance resolution. Merges members from parent
//!   classes and traits into a unified `ClassInfo`
//! - `virtual_members` — Virtual member provider abstraction. Defines the
//!   [`VirtualMemberProvider`](virtual_members::VirtualMemberProvider) trait and
//!   merge logic for members synthesized from `@method`/`@property` tags,
//!   `@mixin` classes, and framework-specific patterns (e.g. Laravel)
//! - `resolution` — Class and function lookup / name resolution (multi-phase:
//!   fqn_uri_index → PSR-4 → stubs)
//! - `type_engine` — The shared type-resolution engine: subject extraction,
//!   subject-to-`ClassInfo` resolution, call/return-type resolution, and
//!   variable type inference, consumed by completion, diagnostics, hover,
//!   definition, and signature help
//! - `highlight` — Document highlighting (`textDocument/documentHighlight`).
//!   When the cursor lands on a symbol, returns all other occurrences in the
//!   current file so the editor can highlight them.  Uses the precomputed
//!   `SymbolMap` with no additional parsing.  Variables are scoped to their
//!   enclosing function/closure; class names, members, functions, and constants
//!   are file-global.
//! - `semantic_tokens` — Semantic tokens (`textDocument/semanticTokens/full`).
//!   Type-aware syntax highlighting that goes beyond TextMate grammars.
//!   Maps `SymbolMap` spans to LSP semantic token types (class, interface,
//!   enum, method, property, parameter, variable, function, constant) with
//!   modifiers (declaration, static, readonly, deprecated, abstract).
//!   Resolves `ClassReference` spans to distinguish classes from interfaces,
//!   enums, and traits.  Template parameter names from `@template` tags are
//!   emitted as `typeParameter` tokens.
//! - `code_actions` — Code actions (`textDocument/codeAction`). Provides:
//!   - `code_actions::import_class` — Import class quick-fix (add a `use`
//!     statement for unresolved class names)
//!   - `code_actions::remove_unused_import` — Remove unused import quick-fix
//!     (delete individual or all unused `use` statements)
//!   - `code_actions::replace_fqcn` — Import qualified classes, functions,
//!     and constants and replace their file-local usages with short names
//!   - `code_actions::generate_constructor` — Generate a constructor from
//!     non-static properties
//!   - `code_actions::generate_getter_setter` — Generate `getX()`/`setX()`
//!     accessor methods (or `isX()` for `bool` properties) from a property
//!     declaration
//! - [`diagnostics`] — Diagnostic collection and delivery.  Native
//!   diagnostics prefer the pull model (`textDocument/diagnostic`, LSP
//!   3.17) whenever the client supports it.  Push diagnostics
//!   (`textDocument/publishDiagnostics`) are a compatibility fallback for
//!   clients that do not support pull diagnostics; the server should not
//!   mix both native delivery models for the same client.
//!   Currently implemented providers:
//!   - `diagnostics::deprecated` — `@deprecated` usage diagnostics (strikethrough
//!     via `DiagnosticTag::Deprecated` on references to deprecated symbols)
//!   - `diagnostics::unused_imports` — unused `use` dimming
//!     (`DiagnosticTag::Unnecessary` on imports with no references in the file)
//!   - `diagnostics::unknown_classes` — unknown class diagnostics
//!     (`Severity::Warning` on `ClassReference` spans that cannot be resolved
//!     through any resolution phase)
//!   - `diagnostics::unresolved_member_access` — opt-in diagnostic
//!     (`Severity::Hint` on `MemberAccess` spans where the subject type
//!     cannot be resolved at all; enabled via `[diagnostics]
//!     unresolved-member-access = true` in `.phpantom.toml`)
//! - [`docblock`] — PHPDoc block parsing, split into submodules:
//!   - `docblock::tags` — tag extraction (`@return`, `@var`, `@property`, `@method`,
//!     `@mixin`, `@deprecated`, `@phpstan-assert`, docblock text retrieval)
//!   - `docblock::conditional` — PHPStan conditional return type parsing
//!   - `docblock::type_strings` — type utilities (`split_type_token`)
//!   - `docblock::shapes` — PHPStan array shape parsing
//!     (`parse_array_shape`, `extract_array_shape_value_type`) and object shape
//!     parsing (`parse_object_shape`, `extract_object_shape_property_type`,
//!     `is_object_shape`)
