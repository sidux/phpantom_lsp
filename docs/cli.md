# CLI Reference

PHPantom is a language server, but it also ships CLI tools for batch
analysis, automated fixing, and formatting. These run the same engine
that powers the editor, so results are consistent between what you see
in your editor and what CI reports.

## Modes

| Command                  | Purpose                                              |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `phpantom_lsp`           | Start the LSP server over stdin/stdout (the default) |
| `phpantom_lsp --tcp 9257`| Start the LSP server listening on a TCP port         |
| `phpantom_lsp analyze`   | Report diagnostics across the project                |
| `phpantom_lsp fix`       | Apply automated code fixes across the project        |
| `phpantom_lsp format`    | Format PHP files and Blade templates                 |
| `phpantom_lsp move`      | Move classes or namespaces and update references     |
| `phpantom_lsp init`      | Generate a default `.phpantom.toml` config file      |

Running with no subcommand starts the language server. Editors launch
this automatically.

---

## `move`

Moves a class or namespace and updates its declarations, imports, and references
across the project. Inputs can be fully-qualified names or PSR-4 paths:

```sh
phpantom_lsp move 'App\Old\Widget' 'App\Domain\Gadget'
phpantom_lsp move src/Old/Widget.php src/Domain/Gadget.php
phpantom_lsp move 'App\Old' 'App\Domain'
phpantom_lsp move src/Old src/Domain
phpantom_lsp move --dry-run --format json src/Old src/Domain
```

`FROM` decides what is being moved, and `TO` is read the same way: a class
moves to a full destination name, so `move 'App\Old\Widget' 'App\Domain'`
renames the class to `Domain`, and moving it into `App\Domain` under its own
name is written out as `'App\Domain\Widget'`.

Path forms require a Composer PSR-4 mapping. A file identifies one class and a
directory identifies its namespace prefix. The command refuses occupied class
destinations and namespace merges with clashing class names before writing any
files.

A destination no PSR-4 mapping covers rewrites the declarations and their
references, but no file can follow them, which leaves the autoloader unable to
find what moved. That is reported as a warning, so a script can catch it. A
destination under a *different* mapping is an ordinary move: the files follow it
to that mapping's directory.

### What a move could not reach

The rewriter only reaches what it can resolve as a symbol. A namespace named in
a Blade template, a Doctrine or Symfony YAML config, a PHPStan baseline, or a
plain path string is invisible to it, and so is a directory spelled out inside
`app_path('Elastic/Config/ILM/')`. Rewriting those is out of scope: nothing can
tell whether a string is a path or a label, and the matching key in a deployment
secret is out of reach entirely.

So the move reports them instead. Once the plan is built, the project is scanned
as it will look afterwards, and every leftover mention of the old name or the old
location becomes a warning with the file and line it sits on:

```
Would move namespace `App\Entity` to `App\Domain\Entity` (71 file(s) changed, 1 path(s) moved).
Warning: config/packages/doctrine.yaml:26: The old path `src/Entity` still appears here. ...
Warning: src/Repository/SeasonRepository.php:65: The old name `App\Entity` still appears here. ...
```

`files_changed` can then be read against a stated list of what was left alone,
rather than assumed complete. The scan covers every file regardless of extension,
skipping `vendor/`, `.git/`, and anything `.gitignore` or `[indexing] exclude`
rules out.

### Options

| Flag                   | Description                                                        |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `FROM`                 | Source class, namespace, PHP file, or PSR-4 directory.             |
| `TO`                   | Destination name or path, of the same kind as `FROM`.              |
| `--dry-run`            | Validate and report the move without changing the project.         |
| `--no-colour`          | Disable coloured output.                                           |
| `--project-root <DIR>` | Project root directory. Defaults to the current working directory. |
| `--format <FORMAT>`    | Output format: `table` (default), `github`, or `json`.             |

`--format json` emits the same `{"totals": …, "files": …, "errors": []}` shape
`analyze` does, with the move's own counters under a `move` key, so both commands
can be consumed by the same tooling. `--format github` emits workflow
annotations; the default `table` adds them automatically when `GITHUB_ACTIONS`
is set.

### Exit codes

| Code | Meaning                                      |
| ---- | -------------------------------------------- |
| 0    | Move applied, or valid dry-run completed     |
| 1    | Invalid input, conflict, or filesystem error |

---

## TCP Transport

By default PHPantom communicates over stdin/stdout, which is what most
editors expect. The `--tcp` flag switches to TCP transport instead,
which is useful when you want to attach a debugger to the server
process, connect from an IDE plugin that prefers a network socket, or
just poke at the JSON-RPC stream with `nc` or `socat`.

The server binds to the given address, accepts a single client
connection, serves it, and exits when the client disconnects.

```sh
phpantom_lsp --tcp 9257                  # listen on 127.0.0.1:9257
phpantom_lsp --tcp 127.0.0.1:9257       # same, explicit host
phpantom_lsp --tcp 0.0.0.0:9257         # listen on all interfaces
phpantom_lsp --tcp 0                    # OS picks a free port
```

When the server starts it prints the bound address to stderr:

```
PHPantom LSP listening on tcp://127.0.0.1:9257
```

This is especially handy with port `0`: the OS assigns an available
port and the server tells you which one it picked.

### Connecting

Any LSP client that supports TCP can connect. For quick manual testing:

```sh
# In one terminal, start the server:
phpantom_lsp --tcp 9257

# In another terminal, connect and send JSON-RPC:
nc 127.0.0.1 9257
```

### Options

| Flag              | Description                                                              |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `--tcp <ADDR>`    | Address to listen on. Full `HOST:PORT` or just `PORT` (defaults to `127.0.0.1`). |

---

## `analyze`

Scans PHP files and reports PHPantom diagnostics in a PHPStan-style
table format. The goal is full symbol resolution: every class, member,
and function call in your codebase should be resolvable. When that
holds, completion and hover work everywhere, and PHPStan gets the type
information it needs at every level.

Use it to find and fix the spots where the editor can't resolve a
symbol, so you can achieve and maintain full type coverage across
the project.

### What it checks

It doesn't try to find every possible bug. Its main focus is symbol
resolution: every class, member, and function call should point to
something real. It also catches basic correctness issues like wrong
argument counts and missing interface implementations. When a codebase
passes cleanly, completions work everywhere for every developer on the
team.

That makes it useful in a few situations:

- **Teams that just want completions to work in their editor.** If
  your goal is "every `->` and `::` resolves to something" rather
  than "catch every possible runtime error," PHPantom's analysis
  covers exactly that.
- **As a companion to PHPStan at a moderate level.** A team running
  PHPStan at level 4 (catching dead code and type mismatches) can add
  PHPantom's analysis to enforce that every class, member, and function
  is resolvable across the full codebase. PHPStan catches logic errors,
  PHPantom catches structural gaps. Together they cover a useful quality
  surface without the effort of configuring PHPStan at max level.
- **As a quick sanity check.** Point it at a Composer project and it
  reports what it finds. No baselines, no ignore files, no level to
  choose. The only configuration worth knowing about is
  `unresolved-member-access`: enable it in `.phpantom.toml` to also
  flag member access on variables that are `mixed`, or whose type could
  not be worked out (off by default because it is noisy on untyped
  codebases).

> [!NOTE]
> There are still occasional false positives, though they are getting
> fewer with each release. If you hit one, please
> [report it](https://github.com/PHPantom-dev/phpantom_lsp/issues).

### Usage

```sh
phpantom_lsp analyze                             # scan entire project
phpantom_lsp analyze src/                        # scan a subdirectory
phpantom_lsp analyze src/Foo.php                 # scan a single file
phpantom_lsp analyze app/ lib/Helper.php         # scan several paths at once
phpantom_lsp analyze --severity warning          # errors and warnings only
phpantom_lsp analyze --severity error            # errors only
phpantom_lsp analyze --project-root /path/to/app # explicit project root
phpantom_lsp analyze --no-colour                 # plain text output
phpantom_lsp analyze --debug -vv                 # trace file-by-file progress
```

### Options

| Flag                       | Description                                                      |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `[PATH]...`                | Files or directories to analyze. Repeatable; the results are the union of every path given. Defaults to the entire project. |
| `--severity <LEVEL>`       | Minimum severity: `all` (default), `warning`, or `error`.        |
| `--project-root <DIR>`     | Project root directory. Defaults to the current working directory.|
| `--no-colour`              | Disable ANSI colour output.                                      |
| `--format <FORMAT>`        | Output format: `table` (default), `github`, or `json`.           |
| `--debug`                  | Print each file path as it is analyzed and disable the progress bar. Also reports files that take unusually long. |
| `-v`, `-vv`, `-vvv`        | Increase verbosity. With `--debug`: `-v` adds per-file durations, `-vv` adds worker ids and parse-phase tracing, `-vvv` adds memory usage. `-vv` and above imply `--debug`. `-v` alone prints a timing summary for the parse, class-population, and diagnostic phases. |

### Exit codes

| Code | Meaning                       |
| ---- | ------------------------------ |
| 0    | No diagnostics found            |
| 1    | Diagnostics were found          |
| 2    | A `PATH` argument does not exist |

### Example output

```
 ------ -------------------------------------------
   Line   src/Service/UserService.php
 ------ -------------------------------------------
   15     Unknown class 'App\Models\LegacyUser'.
          🪪  unknown_class
   42     Call to undefined method Post::archive().
          🪪  unknown_member
 ------ -------------------------------------------
```

### Reported diagnostics

The analyze command reports the same diagnostics you see in your editor.
Each has a rule identifier shown below the message.

| Identifier               | Severity | Description                                          |
| ------------------------ | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `syntax_error`           | Error    | PHP parse errors                                     |
| `unknown_class`          | Warning  | Class, interface, trait, or enum not resolvable       |
| `unknown_member`         | Warning  | Property or method not found on the resolved class    |

| `deprecated`             | Hint     | Reference to a `@deprecated` symbol                   |

---

## `fix`

Applies code fixes across the project. Specify which rules to run, or
omit `--rule` to run all preferred native fixers.

This is useful for cleaning up an entire codebase in one pass. For
example, a project with hundreds of unused `use` statements can be
cleaned up in seconds rather than file by file.

```sh
phpantom_lsp fix                                  # apply all preferred fixers
phpantom_lsp fix --rule unused_import             # only remove unused imports
phpantom_lsp fix --rule unused_import --rule deprecated  # multiple rules
phpantom_lsp fix --dry-run                        # preview without writing
phpantom_lsp fix src/                             # restrict to a subdirectory
phpantom_lsp fix src/Foo.php                      # fix a single file
phpantom_lsp fix --project-root /path/to/app      # explicit project root
```

### Options

| Flag                       | Description                                                          |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `[PATH]`                   | File or directory to fix. Defaults to the entire project.            |
| `--rule <RULE>`            | Rule to apply (repeatable). Omit to run all preferred native rules.  |
| `--dry-run`                | Report what would change without writing files.                      |
| `--with-phpstan`           | Enable PHPStan-based fixers (future feature).                        |
| `--project-root <DIR>`     | Project root directory. Defaults to the current working directory.    |
| `--no-colour`              | Disable ANSI colour output.                                         |

### Exit codes

| Code | Meaning                                          |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| 0    | Fixes applied successfully (or nothing to fix)   |
| 1    | Error (bad arguments, write failure, etc.)       |
| 2    | Dry-run found fixable issues (nothing written)   |

### Available rules

Rules correspond to diagnostic identifiers.

| Rule               | Description                    |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| `unused_import`    | Remove unused `use` statements |

### Example output

```
 ------ -------------------------------------------
   Line   src/Service/UserService.php
 ------ -------------------------------------------
    5     Unused import 'App\Models\LegacyUser'
          🔧  unused_import
    6     Unused import 'App\Support\OldHelper'
          🔧  unused_import
 ------ -------------------------------------------

 [FIXED] Applied 2 fixes across 1 file
```

### Dry-run example

```sh
phpantom_lsp fix --dry-run --project-root /path/to/app
```

```
 ------ -------------------------------------------
   Line   src/Service/UserService.php
 ------ -------------------------------------------
    5     Unused import 'App\Models\LegacyUser'
          🔧  unused_import
 ------ -------------------------------------------

 [DRY RUN] 1 fix in 1 file (not applied)
```

### Idempotency

Running `fix` twice produces the same result as running it once. If
all issues are already resolved, the command exits with code 0 and
writes nothing.

---

## `format`

Formats every PHP file and Blade template in the project with the same
formatter the editor runs on save, or, with `--check`, reports the files
that are not formatted and exits non-zero without writing anything. That
is the role `blade-formatter -c`, `phpcs`, and `php-cs-fixer --dry-run`
play in a pipeline, so a CI job can require that a pull request ran the
formatter.

```sh
phpantom_lsp format                               # format the whole project
phpantom_lsp format --check                       # report unformatted files, write nothing
phpantom_lsp format resources/views               # restrict to a subdirectory
phpantom_lsp format app/Foo.php                   # format a single file
phpantom_lsp format --check --format github       # annotate a pull request diff
phpantom_lsp format --project-root /path/to/app   # explicit project root
```

Each file goes through the strategy PHPantom resolves for the project, so
a run honours a Laravel Pint, php-cs-fixer, or PHP_CodeSniffer the project
depends on, and uses the built-in formatter otherwise. Blade templates
resolve separately: Pint when the project formats Blade with it, the
built-in reindenter otherwise. See
[`[formatting]`](configuration.md#formatting) for how that is decided and how
to override it. The run opens with a line on stderr naming what it
resolved, so a CI log records which formatter enforced the result.

Templates whose indentation is output rather than layout (Envoy task
files, Markdown mail templates, Laravel Boost guidelines) are left alone,
and `--check` never fails a project for having one. Formatting turned off
in `.phpantom.toml` exits 0 with a note rather than reporting every file
as formatted.

### Options

| Flag                       | Description                                                            |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `[PATH]...`                | Files or directories to format. Defaults to the entire project.        |
| `--check`                  | List the files that are not formatted and write nothing.               |
| `--indent-size <N>`        | Spaces per indentation level for Blade templates (default 4).          |
| `--use-tabs`               | Indent Blade templates with tabs instead of spaces.                    |
| `--project-root <DIR>`     | Project root directory. Defaults to the current working directory.     |
| `--no-colour`              | Disable ANSI colour output.                                            |
| `--format <FORMAT>`        | `table` (default), `github`, or `json`.                                |

`--indent-size` and `--use-tabs` reach the built-in Blade reindenter
only, which takes indentation from the editor over LSP and has no other
source for it on the command line. PHP files are formatted to the
project's own rules either way.

### Exit codes

| Code | Meaning                                            |
| ---- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| 0    | Every file is formatted, or every file was written |
| 1    | A file could not be read, formatted, or written    |
| 2    | `--check` found files that are not formatted       |

### Example output

```sh
phpantom_lsp format --check
```

```
 resources/views/home.blade.php
 src/Service/UserService.php

 [CHECK] 2 files would be reformatted
```

```sh
phpantom_lsp format
```

```
 resources/views/home.blade.php
 src/Service/UserService.php

 [FORMATTED] Reformatted 2 files
```

### Idempotency

Running `format` twice produces the same result as running it once, and
`--check` passes immediately afterwards. That is what makes the pair
usable as a CI gate: the job runs `--check`, and a contributor clears it
by running the command without it.

---

## `init`

Creates a `.phpantom.toml` in the current directory with a JSON schema
directive and a link to the configuration reference. The file is
intentionally minimal — add only the settings you want to override.
Editors with TOML schema support (Zed, VS Code + Even Better TOML,
Neovim) provide autocomplete and hover documentation for all available
options via the schema. Safe to run if the file already exists (it will
not overwrite).

```sh
phpantom_lsp init
phpantom_lsp init --global   # user-wide defaults, inherited by every project
```

`--global` writes to the platform config directory
(`~/.config/phpantom_lsp/.phpantom.toml` on Linux and macOS) instead, creating it
if needed. Every project reads that file first and merges its own
`.phpantom.toml` over it key by key, so put the settings you want
everywhere in the global file and keep project configs to the
differences.

See the [Configuration Reference](configuration.md) for details on
available settings.

---

## CI Integration

PHPantom works well as a lightweight CI gate. It's a single static
binary with no runtime dependencies (no PHP, no Composer, no Node). Drop
it into a pipeline and point it at your project root.

### Why use it in CI?

Editor diagnostics only help the developer who has the editor open.
CI analysis protects the whole team: no PR can merge if it introduces
an unresolvable symbol, regardless of which editor each developer uses.
Over time this keeps the codebase fully navigable, so completions,
hover, and go-to-definition work everywhere for everyone.

It also complements PHPStan rather than replacing it. PHPStan is better
at catching logical errors, type mismatches, and dead code. PHPantom is
better at catching structural gaps: unknown classes, unresolvable
members, missing implementations. Running both gives you broad coverage
without needing PHPStan at max level to get full symbol resolution.

### GitHub Actions example

```yaml
name: Type Coverage
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  phpantom:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Use --no-dev to catch production code that depends on dev-only
      # packages (e.g. calling PHPUnit classes from application code).
      - name: Install Composer dependencies
        run: composer install --no-interaction --prefer-dist --no-dev

      - name: Install PHPantom
        run: |
          curl -sL https://github.com/PHPantom-dev/phpantom_lsp/releases/download/0.6.0/phpantom_lsp-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz | tar xz
          chmod +x phpantom_lsp

      - name: Check type coverage
        run: ./phpantom_lsp analyze --severity warning --no-colour src/
```

The `analyze` step fails the build if any class, member, or function
cannot be resolved (including unused imports). The output is clean and
readable in the CI log.

### Common patterns

**Diagnostics gate.** Fail the build when PHPantom finds unresolvable
symbols:

```sh
phpantom_lsp analyze --severity warning --project-root . --no-colour
```

**Enforce clean imports.** Fail the build when unused imports exist:

```sh
phpantom_lsp fix --dry-run --rule unused_import --project-root . --no-colour
```

**Formatting gate.** Fail the build when a file was committed
unformatted:

```sh
phpantom_lsp format --check --project-root . --no-colour
```

**Pre-commit hook.** Clean up imports before every commit:

```sh
phpantom_lsp fix --rule unused_import --project-root .
```

**Combine analyze and fix.** Run fixes first, then check what remains:

```sh
phpantom_lsp fix --project-root .
phpantom_lsp analyze --project-root .
```
