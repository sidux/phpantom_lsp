## Severity philosophy

PHPantom assigns diagnostic severity based on runtime consequences:

| Severity        | Criteria                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Examples                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

## D5. External tool diagnostic suppression actions

**Impact: Low · Complexity: Low (per tool, after proxy exists)**

PHPantom's own inline suppression (`// @phpantom-ignore code`) has
shipped. PHPStan suppression is also implemented ("Ignore PHPStan
error" / "Remove unnecessary @phpstan-ignore"). The PHPCS proxy itself
has also shipped (`src/diagnostics/external/phpcs.rs`, `[phpcs]` config
section), but nothing wires up a suppression action for it yet. What
remains is wiring up suppression actions for additional external tool
proxies:

- PHPCS: `// phpcs:ignore [Sniff.Name]` or `// phpcs:disable` /
  `// phpcs:enable` blocks. The proxy exists; only the suppression
  action is missing.
- PHPMD (3.0): `#[SuppressWarnings(RuleName::class)]` as a PHP
  attribute. Blocked on the proxy itself (D10).

---

## D6. Unreachable code diagnostic

**Impact: Low-Medium · Complexity: Medium**

Dim code that appears after unconditional control flow exits:
`return`, `throw`, `exit`, `die`, `continue`, `break`. This is a
Phase 1 (fast) diagnostic since it requires only AST structure, not
type resolution.

### Behaviour

| Scenario                                           | Rendering                           |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Code after `return $x;` in same block              | Dimmed (DiagnosticTag::UNNECESSARY) |
| Code after `throw new \Exception()`                | Dimmed                              |
| Code after `exit(1)` or `die()`                    | Dimmed                              |
| Code after `continue` or `break` in a loop         | Dimmed                              |
| Code after `if (...) { return; } else { return; }` | Dimmed (both branches exit)         |

Severity: **Hint** with `DiagnosticTag::UNNECESSARY` so editors dim
the text rather than underlining it. This matches how unused imports
are rendered.

### Implementation

Walk the AST statement list. After encountering a statement that
unconditionally exits the current scope (return, throw, expression
statement containing `exit`/`die`), mark all subsequent statements in
the same block as unreachable. The span covers from the start of the
first unreachable statement to the end of the last statement in the
block.

Phase 1 only handles the simple single-block case. Whole-branch
analysis (both if/else branches exit) is a future refinement.

### Debugging value

When our type engine silently resolves a method to a `never` return
type (e.g. an incorrectly resolved overload), unreachable code after
the call becomes visible, signalling the bug.

## D10. PHPMD diagnostic proxy

**Impact: Low · Complexity: Medium**

Proxy PHPMD (PHP Mess Detector) diagnostics into the editor, following
the same pattern as the existing PHPStan proxy. PHPMD 3.0 (once
released) is the target version. It will get a `[phpmd]` TOML section
with `command`, `timeout`, and tool-specific options mirroring the
`[phpstan]` schema.

### Prerequisites

- PHPMD 3.0 must be released. Current 2.x output formats and rule
  naming may change.
- The diagnostic suppression code action (D5) can add PHPMD's
  `@SuppressWarnings(PHPMD.[RuleName])` syntax once the proxy exists.

### Implementation

1. Add a `[phpmd]` section to the config schema in `src/config.rs`
   with `command` (default `"vendor/bin/phpmd"`), `timeout`, and
   an `enabled` flag.
2. Run PHPMD with XML or JSON output on the current file (or changed
   files) and parse the results into LSP diagnostics.
3. Map PHPMD rule names to diagnostic codes so that suppression
   actions (D5) can insert the correct `@SuppressWarnings` annotation.
4. Respect the same debounce and queueing logic used by the PHPStan
   proxy to avoid overwhelming the tool on rapid edits.

---

## D15. Unused parameter diagnostic

**Impact: Low · Complexity: Medium**

Flag function and method parameters that are never read inside the
body. This was intentionally excluded from D4 (unused variable
diagnostic) because false positives are common for callbacks, interface
implementations, and framework conventions (e.g. Laravel event
listeners) that require specific parameter signatures even when not
all parameters are used. Users can now silence false positives with
`// @phpantom-ignore unused_parameter`.

### Scope

1. Function and method parameters (including closures and arrow
   functions) that are never read inside their body.
2. Constructor parameters that are not promoted and never read.

### Exclusions

- Parameters named `$_` or starting with `$_` (intentional discard).
- Promoted constructor parameters (they are property assignments).
- Parameters in abstract methods and interface method signatures
  (no body to check).

## D16. `unreachable_match_arm` ignores literal subject types

**Impact: Low-Medium · Complexity: Medium**

`scalar_type_label` in `src/diagnostics/match_type_errors.rs` answers
`None` for a literal type (`'exception'`, `42`), so a subject the
resolver typed as one exact value never reaches the arm check and no
arm is ever reported unreachable. The comment there explains why: a
literal was as often what survived after resolution lost an
alternative it could not type as it was a genuine one-value subject,
and taking the claim without that evidence produced false positives.

The resolver no longer loses those alternatives. An unresolvable
branch now widens the union it belongs to instead of dropping out of
it, so a literal that reaches this diagnostic is a claim the resolver
stands behind.

**Fix:** Give `TypeKind::Literal` its scalar kind in
`scalar_type_label` and check the resulting arms. Cover the case the
old comment was guarding against with a test: a subject whose other
branch cannot be typed must still produce no diagnostic, because it
now resolves to `mixed` rather than to the surviving literal.

## D17. `docblock_native_mismatch` only judges nullability

**Impact: Low · Complexity: Medium-High**

```php
/** @param int $name */
function greet(string $name): void {}    // not flagged: int is not string at all

/** @param Foo $value */
function take(Bar $value): void {}       // not flagged: `Foo` may alias `Bar`
```

`src/diagnostics/docblock_native_mismatch.rs` compares a documented type
against its native hint on one axis only: whether the annotation admits a
`null` the signature rules out. A documented type that is not a subtype of
the native hint on any *other* axis (`@param int` on a `string`, `@return
array` on a `: string`) stays silent. That is the check PHPStan's
`IncompatiblePhpDocTypeRule` performs, and the one the existing
`is_type_compatible` in `src/diagnostics/type_errors/compatibility.rs`
already has the machinery for.

Covering it means resolving the documented type's bare names first, since a
`Foo` that a `@template` list or an imported `@psalm-type` alias stands
behind may well be the native `Bar` after resolution. The nullability axis
sidesteps that today: a name that resolves to something nullable never
spells `null` itself, so the check simply does not fire on it.

**Fix:** Resolve the documented type's names against the declaration's own
`@template` list, the enclosing class's, and the file's
`@psalm-type`/`@psalm-import-type` tags, then run the comparison through
`is_type_compatible` rather than the nullability test alone.

## D18. `array<int, T>` is accepted wherever a `list<T>` is declared

**Impact: Low · Complexity: Medium-High**

```php
/**
 * @param list<int> $values
 * @return list<int>
 */
function keep(array $values): array {
    return array_filter($values, fn ($v) => $v > 3);  // array<int, int>, not flagged
}
```

`is_type_compatible` in `src/diagnostics/type_errors/compatibility.rs`
carries an explicit MAYBE hatch for `array<int, X>` reaching a `list<X>`
parameter or return type, on the grounds that PHP codebases spell the two
interchangeably. The core `is_subtype_of` already rejects the direction
(only `list<X>` satisfies `array<int, X>`, not the reverse), so the hatch
is the only thing standing between us and PHPStan's report here.

Now that `array_filter()` reports the `array<int, T>` it actually
produces, the hatch is what keeps the second half of the over-claim
alive: a function that hands back an unwrapped filter result still
passes a declared `list<T>`.

**Fix:** Drop the `array<int, X> → list<X>` arm and audit the corpus
under `projects/` for what it starts reporting. The arm exists because
plain `array<int, X>` is what an unannotated array resolves to in many
places, so retiring it wants the resolver to answer `list<X>` for the
shapes that genuinely are lists (literal arrays, `array_values()`,
appended-to locals) first. Pay for it with resolver precision, the same
way the supertype-where-subtype hatch was retired.
