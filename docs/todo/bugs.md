# PHPantom — Bug Fixes

Every bug below must be fixed at its root cause. "Detect the
symptom and suppress the diagnostic" is not an acceptable fix.
If the type resolution pipeline produces wrong data, fix the
pipeline so it produces correct data. Downstream consumers
(diagnostics, hover, completion, definition) should never need
to second-guess upstream output.

## B26. A panic during parse/extraction permanently poisons the URI via `parse_inflight`

**Severity: Medium (file never resolvable again + 200 ms stall per lookup) · Confirmed paths, low-probability trigger**

`parse_and_cache_file` (`src/resolution.rs:259-294`) inserts the
URI into `parse_inflight`, does the work, then removes it — with
no drop guard. If the work unwinds, the `remove` at line 280/293
never runs. From then on, **every** `parse_and_cache_file` call
for that URI takes the `wait_for_cached_result` path
(`resolution.rs:299-310`): a 200 × 1 ms spin that then returns
stale-or-`None` — the file can never be (re)parsed until server
restart, and each attempt burns 200 ms on a blocking thread.

The panic surface is real: `with_parsed_program`
(`src/parser/mod.rs:855-919`) wraps only the **slow path** in
`catch_unwind` (line 913). The thread-local parse-cache fast path
runs both the mago parse (lines 877-894) and the extraction
closure (lines 896-909) **outside** any `catch_unwind` — so with
a warm parse cache, a parser or extraction panic escapes,
contradicting the function's own "a parser panic doesn't crash
the LSP server" contract. Outer layers like the completion
handler's `catch_unwind` (`src/completion/handler.rs:1010`) then
swallow the panic, so the server keeps running with the URI stuck
in `parse_inflight` and nothing in the log but one panic line.

**Fix:** two independent hardenings, both worth doing:

1. Hold the `parse_inflight` entry in an RAII guard whose `Drop`
   removes the URI, so unwinding cleans up.
2. Wrap the fast path of `with_parsed_program` in `catch_unwind`
   like the slow path (evicting the poisoned parse-cache entry on
   panic so the next call re-parses).


## B27. String literal type comparison is quote-style sensitive

**Severity: Low (false-positive argument diagnostic) · Confirmed**

`literal_is_subtype_of` (`src/php_type.rs:3297-3369`) compares two
`PhpType::Literal` string values with plain `lit == other_lit`. Both
the argument-narrowing path
(`src/diagnostics/type_errors.rs`, argument literal narrowing) and
the docblock literal-type parser
(`src/php_type.rs:4095`, `ast::Type::LiteralString`) build the
`Literal` payload from the **raw source text including quote
characters**, so a double-quoted argument literal never equals a
single-quoted docblock literal even when their unquoted contents are
identical.

**Trigger:**

```php
/** @param 'asc'|'desc' $direction */
function orderBy(string $column, string $direction): void {}

function test(): void {
    orderBy('id', "desc"); // flagged: "desc" (double-quoted) != 'desc' (single-quoted)
}
```

Single-quoted usage (`orderBy('id', 'desc')`) is unaffected, since
both sides happen to agree on quote style in that case.

**Fix:** compare the two literals by their unquoted content instead
of raw source text. Both `LiteralString` (source) and
`LiteralStringType` (docblock) already carry a parsed, unquoted
`value` field alongside `raw` — normalise through that (or strip
quotes consistently) before the equality check in
`literal_is_subtype_of`, and make sure the `PhpType::Literal`
constructors that currently pass through `raw` for strings do the
same.
