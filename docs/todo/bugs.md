# PHPantom — Bug Fixes

Every bug below must be fixed at its root cause. "Detect the
symptom and suppress the diagnostic" is not an acceptable fix.
If the type resolution pipeline produces wrong data, fix the
pipeline so it produces correct data. Downstream consumers
(diagnostics, hover, completion, definition) should never need
to second-guess upstream output.

Each entry below carries an **Impact · Complexity** rating using the same
scale defined in [`docs/todo.md`](../todo.md); that table is also where
each bug's row lives in the current sprint/backlog.

All entries below come from triage of the PHPStan Source sample project,
re-swept on 2026-08-27 (180 confirmed false positives after the genuine
findings were patched in the sample, down from 242 at the 2026-08-25
triage). Site counts refer to that sweep; every mechanism was either
reproduced in a minimal project or confirmed by reading the guard
construct PHPStan honours. The sweep is a snapshot, so a site named here
may already read differently: re-run the analyser before working an
entry, and trim the shapes that no longer reproduce. Line numbers drift
by a line or two between sweeps — match on the surrounding construct, not
on the number.

Entries are grouped by the mechanism that has to change, not by the
symptom that surfaced: one entry is one root cause, however many shapes
it shows up in. Splitting a shape out into its own entry because it
reads differently in the source is how this list grew past forty in the
first place. If two entries would be fixed by the same change, they are
one entry. Defects too small to earn a row of their own are collected in
[B301](#b301-narrowing-defects-with-a-single-site-each) rather than given
one each.

Of the 180 sites in the latest sweep, 110 are attributed to an entry
below. The unattributed remainder is described in
[Not yet attributed](#not-yet-attributed).

## Narrowing

### B270. Narrowing a repeated or non-variable subject doesn't survive

**Impact: High · Complexity: Very High**

42 sites — by far the largest cluster here, and one root cause: what the
narrowing store keys a proof against, and what invalidates it. PHPStan
keys specified types by expression string and keeps them until something
writes to that expression. We handle plain variables reliably and
everything else fragilely, which surfaces as four shapes. Related to the
reconciliation engine planned as
[T20](type-inference.md#t20-type-narrowing-reconciliation-engine).

**a. A guard on a call's result doesn't narrow the same call afterwards**
(17 sites). This ubiquitous idiom is clean under PHPStan and re-resolved
from the declaration by us, which hands back the wide type:

```php
if ($analyserResult->getDependencies() !== null) {
    $this->switchTmpFile($analyserResult->getDependencies(), ...); // non-null here
}
```

Concentrated around reflection accessors (`getFileName()`,
`getDocComment()`, `getResolvedPhpDoc()`, `getDependencies()`). The
ternary spelling of the same idiom narrows correctly now.
Sites: `src/Analyser/NodeScopeResolver.php:1121, 5320, 5366`,
`src/Analyser/ResultCache/ResultCacheManager.php:858`,
`src/Command/AnalyseApplication.php:329, 333, 337`,
`src/PhpDoc/PhpDocInheritanceResolver.php:246, 282`,
`src/Reflection/BetterReflection/BetterReflectionProvider.php:302 (×2), 348, 356`,
`src/Reflection/Php/PhpClassReflectionExtension.php:299, 313, 678, 682, 823, 866`,
`src/Rules/Exceptions/TooWidePropertyHookThrowTypeRule.php:61`.

**b. Property fetches, array dims and call chains lose their narrowing**
(16 sites). `instanceof` / `!== null` / `is_string()` guards whose
subject is not a plain variable, in specific reproduced shapes:

```php
// 1. Member use inside the condition breaks the narrowing for the body:
if ($this->pair !== null && $this->pair[0] instanceof SubA && $this->pair[0]->n > 0) {
    $this->pair[0]->n;        // "Property 'n' not found" — without the third leg it works
}
// 2. Chained getters re-read in the same condition:
if ($h->getExpr()->getExpr() instanceof Vari && is_string($h->getExpr()->getExpr()->name) && $flag) { ... }
// 3. Plain property fetch behind an elseif-continue:
if ($tag->value === null) { continue; } elseif (!($tag->value instanceof Sub)) { continue; }
$tag->value->n;               // lost
```

Sites: `src/Analyser/MutatingScope.php:1778, 2946, 2949`,
`src/Analyser/NodeScopeResolver.php:1689, 1702, 2874, 3866, 4838, 4844, 5000, 5103`,
`src/Analyser/ExprHandler/AssignHandler.php:1027`,
`src/Analyser/TypeSpecifier.php:600`,
`src/Rules/FunctionDefinitionCheck.php:195` (narrowed `$param`
`use`-captured by a closure),
`src/Rules/PhpDoc/InvalidPhpDocTagValueRule.php:98, 99`,
`src/Rules/TooWideTypehints/TooWideTypeCheck.php:214`,
`src/Type/Constant/ConstantArrayType.php:2567, 3503`,
`src/Type/ValueOfType.php:59`.

**c. Re-testing a condition, or a boolean flag holding it, doesn't
re-apply its narrowing** (8 sites). Three shapes PHPStan's
specified-types machinery handles:

```php
// 1. The identical condition re-tested later:
if (count($args) > 0) { $acceptor = Selector::selectFromArgs(...); }
if (count($args) > 0) { use($acceptor); }                    // non-null

// 2. A boolean flag recording an instanceof, then read to pick a subject:
$constArrayIsI = $types[$i] instanceof ConstantArrayType && ...;
$constArray = $constArrayIsI ? $types[$i] : $types[$j];      // ConstantArrayType

// 3. Two variables assigned together; checking one implies the other:
if ($assertions === null) { return null; } // $acceptor was set iff $assertions was
```

Shape 2 accounts for the whole `TypeCombinator` cluster: the flag is
recorded, but the subject it narrows is an array dim rather than a
plain variable, so the ternary that reads the flag back hands out the
declared element type.
Sites: `src/Analyser/ExprHandler/FuncCallHandler.php:977, 1042`,
`src/Analyser/ExprHandler/MethodCallHandler.php:350`,
`src/Analyser/ExprHandler/StaticCallHandler.php:455`,
`src/Analyser/NodeScopeResolver.php:693, 707, 727, 732`,
`src/Type/TypeCombinator.php:1991, 1994, 2012, 2013, 2020, 2021, 2029`.

**d. Reading a property of `$this` before `$this instanceof Subclass`
kills the narrowing** (1 site, isolated to a two-line repro). The store
drops the proof it should be keeping:

```php
$description = $this->className;        // remove this line and the branch resolves
if ($this instanceof GenericObjectType) {
    $this->getTypes();                  // "Method 'getTypes' not found on ObjectType"
}
```

Regular and promoted properties both trigger it; same-file and
cross-file subclasses both fail. Site: `src/Type/ObjectType.php:744`.

### B274. A null-seeded accumulator filled in a loop keeps `null` (or loses its type entirely)

**Impact: High · Complexity: High**

18 sites, two symptoms of one shape — PHPStan's own scope-merging
idiom, repeated across five files:

```php
$finalScope = null;
foreach ($executionEnds as $e) {
    $endScope = $e->getStatementResult()->getScope();
    if ($finalScope === null) { $finalScope = $endScope; continue; }
    $finalScope = $finalScope->mergeWith($endScope);   // unresolved from here on
}
if ($finalScope !== null) { $finalScope->processNodes(...); }  // still unresolved
```

The `=== null` early-continue must leave the accumulator non-null on
the merge line, and the loop fixed point must not poison the variable
so badly that even an explicit `!== null` guard after the loop can't
recover it. The same root also leaves the accumulator nullable after a
loop that provably runs (`if (count($xs) > 0) { ... foreach ($xs) ... }`
or a literal `$files = [$file]`), and after a foreach over a local
array that every branch pushed into (reproduced minimally; also
`src/Analyser/TypeSpecifier.php:542`).

An inline `/** @var … */` on the assignment inside the loop does not
rescue it either: the accumulator still leaves the loop nullable, so
`return $parameterSchema;` reports the `null` against a declared
`Schema` (`src/DependencyInjection/ContainerFactory.php:403`).

Sites: `src/Analyser/NodeScopeResolver.php:1103, 1112, 1116, 1903, 2001, 2153, 5406, 5414`,
`src/Rules/Properties/SetNonVirtualPropertyHookAssignRule.php:64, 72, 80, 81, 90`,
`src/Rules/TooWideTypehints/TooWideParameterOutTypeCheck.php:47, 56`,
`src/Reflection/BetterReflection/SourceLocator/OptimizedDirectorySourceLocator.php:149, 150`,
`src/Analyser/TypeSpecifier.php:542`,
`src/DependencyInjection/ContainerFactory.php:403`.

### B301. Narrowing defects with a single site each

**Impact: Medium · Complexity: Medium-High**

2 sites, two independent mechanisms. Neither is large enough to earn a
backlog row of its own, so they are collected here rather than filed
separately. Fixing one does not fix the other — take them one bullet at
a time.

**b. An `int|float` subject survives a guard that should split it.**
The plain `is_float()` shape resolves correctly on its own — an
`int|float` subject comes back as `float` in the `is_float()` branch,
`int` in the else, and `int` after a branch that reassigns it. Neither
site reproduces from that shape alone, and neither reproduces from the
constructs named below either, so what carries the defect is the branch
structure around them and not any one of these lines:

```php
// 1. The subject reaches the guard through a swap destructuring,
//    starting out int|float|null; we report `null|int|int|float`.
if ($min !== null && $max !== null && $min > $max) { [$min, $max] = [$max, $min]; }
if (is_float($min)) { $min = (int) ceil($min); }
IntegerRangeType::fromInterval($min, $max);

// 2. An inline `@var int|float` subject checked with an elseif;
//    the elseif branch keeps `int|float` where it must be `int`.
/** @var int|float $newAutoIndex */
$newAutoIndex = $offsetValue + 1;
if (is_float($newAutoIndex)) { … } elseif (!$optional) { $this->nextAutoIndexes = [$newAutoIndex]; }
```

The duplicated `int` and the surviving `null` in the first result say
the assignment, not the guard, is where the type is lost. Both sites sit
several branches deep inside long methods, so the next attempt should
start by bisecting the enclosing method down to a reproducing shape
rather than from the excerpts above. Sites:
`src/Reflection/InitializerExprTypeResolver.php:2533 (both args)`,
`src/Type/Constant/ConstantArrayTypeBuilder.php:242`.

**d. By-reference out-parameters.** Complements
[T41](type-inference.md#t41-param-out-is-parsed-but-never-read):

- A by-ref parameter the callee unconditionally assigns (no
  `@param-out` tag) should get the assigned type after the call
  (`ScopeOps::getTypeFromCache(..., ?string &$key)` always sets a
  `string`; `src/Analyser/MutatingScope.php:1031`).
- The *input* type of a by-ref argument that merely creates the
  variable must not be checked at all — PHPStan skips it
  (`preg_match_all(..., $matches, PREG_OFFSET_CAPTURE)` where the
  variable still holds the previous iteration's shape;
  `src/Parser/RichParser.php:183`).

## Array types

### B286. Array element types are lost by writes, and key checks don't restore them

**Impact: Medium-High · Complexity: Medium-High**

14 sites. Every shape below is the same gap seen from one side or the
other: the element type of an array the engine watched being built, or
the element type a key check proves is there.

- A locally built array of tuples read back by a destructuring foreach:
  `$offsetTypes[$key] = [$trinary, $type];` …
  `foreach ($offsetTypes as $key => [$hasOffsetValue, $offsetType])` —
  both variables come back as `mixed` rather than as the tuple slot the
  write put there
  (`src/Type/Php/ArrayMergeFunctionDynamicReturnTypeExtension.php:188, 250, 255, 258, 300, 306`,
  `src/Type/Php/ArrayReplaceFunctionReturnTypeExtension.php:177, 227, 231, 264, 270`).
- Indexing a docblock shape through two dims unions the tuple slots
  instead of selecting one: `$alternatives[$exprString][1]` on
  `array<string, array{Expr, list<...>}>` returns `Expr|list<...>`
  (`src/Analyser/SpecifiedTypes.php:587`).
- `isset(self::$anonymousClasses[$className])` doesn't make the
  subsequent read of that offset resolve (static property with a
  `@var ClassReflection[]` docblock —
  `src/Reflection/BetterReflection/BetterReflectionProvider.php:170`),
  and `isset($options['default'])` over `array<string, ?Type>` must
  strip `null` from the value type
  (`src/Type/Php/FilterFunctionReturnTypeHelper.php:198`).

The mirror image — where the *key* is what a check proves something
about — resolves correctly now.

## Docblock handling

### B303. A call whose member name is decided at runtime comes back unresolved in situ

**Impact: Low · Complexity: Medium**

2 sites. `TrinaryLogic::{$certainty->name->toString()}()` names a method
PHP only knows at runtime, so the result is `mixed` — which is what the
same shape produces in isolation, whether the name is a variable, a
method call, or a chain, and whether or not the
`// @phpstan-ignore staticMethod.dynamicName` comment above it is
present. In place it comes back unresolved instead, so the two reads off
the assigned variable report that its type could not be worked out:

```php
$expectedCertaintyValue = TrinaryLogic::{$certainty->name->toString()}();
…
if ($expectedCertaintyValue->equals($actualCertaintyValue)) { … }
$expectedCertaintyValue->describe();
```

The assignment sits after a run of eight `instanceof`-guarded early
returns inside a long method, so the next attempt should bisect the
enclosing method down to a reproducing shape rather than starting from
the excerpt above — none of the pieces reproduce on their own. Sites:
`src/Rules/Debug/FileAssertRule.php:222, 227`.

### B302. A docblock sharing a line with code is invisible to the parameter scan

**Impact: Low · Complexity: Medium**

The `@param` scan that types a closure's parameters reads the source
line by line and only recognises a docblock on a line of its own, so a
comment written inline between an assignment and the closure it
documents is skipped:

```php
$collect = /** @param Arg[] $callArgs */ static function (array $callArgs): void { … };
// $callArgs is the bare `array` hint; the annotation is never read
```

The multi-line spelling above the statement works. Both placements are
the same annotation, so a scanner that understands where a docblock
begins and ends — rather than which lines look like comment lines —
would read either. No site in the sample projects; found while working
the closure-signature entry.

## Miscellaneous

No outstanding items.

## Not yet attributed

45 of the 2026-08-27 sweep's 180 sites are not attributed to an entry
above. Most are neighbours of a shape that already has an entry and need
only a read to place; the recurring ones are recorded here so a future
triage starts from them rather than rediscovering them.

- **Four are not our bug.** `PHPStan\ExtensionInstaller\GeneratedConfig`
  is written at install time and is absent from a plain checkout, so
  `GeneratedConfig::EXTENSIONS` genuinely names a class that is not
  there (`src/Analyser/ResultCache/ResultCacheManager.php:1396`,
  `src/Command/CommandHelper.php:309`,
  `src/Diagnose/PHPStanDiagnoseExtension.php:132, 142`). They are
  correct findings against the sample as checked out, not false
  positives; a sweep that counts them is counting four too many.
- **`src/Testing/TestCaseSourceLocatorFactory.php:75` is also not our
  bug.** `dirname($vendorDirProperty->getValue($classLoader))` reads
  Composer's `ClassLoader::$vendorDir`, which its own docblock types
  `string|null`, and nothing between the `hasProperty()` guard and the
  call rules the `null` out. `dirname()` rejects it under
  `strict_types`. PHPStan stays quiet only because reflection reads are
  `mixed` to it, so this is a place where we are the more accurate of the
  two rather than a false positive.
- **A `foreach` key reaching a `string` parameter** —
  `src/DependencyInjection/ConditionalTagsExtension.php:45` and
  `src/Rules/PhpDoc/WrongVariableNameInVarTagRule.php:376` both report
  "expects string, got int", so the key type of an array whose keys are
  strings is coming back as the `int` half of `array-key`.
- **Unresolved receivers with no entry yet**:
  `src/Analyser/ResultCache/ResultCacheManager.php:832, 837` (`$error`),
  `src/DependencyInjection/NeonAdapter.php:102, 103` (`$st`),
  `src/Type/Regex/RegexGroupParser.php:160, 168` (`$child`,
  `$children[$i + 1]`), `src/PhpDoc/StubValidator.php:57`
  (`$pathRoutingParser`), `src/Analyser/ScopeOps.php:511` (an empty
  subject name, which is a reporting bug of its own).
- **`src/Analyser/ResultCache/ResultCacheManager.php:727`** returns
  `non-empty-list<int>|list<string>` where `array<string>` is declared —
  an array built in two branches that keeps the key type of one and the
  value type of the other.
- **`src/Rules/Properties/ExistingClassesInPropertyHookTypehintsRule.php:41`**
  passes `?string` to a `string` parameter.
