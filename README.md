A fast, lightweight PHP language server written in Rust. Ready in seconds, uses a fraction of the RAM other language servers need, and stays responsive throughout. No indexing phase, no waiting.

> PHPantom is in active development. The core editing features are solid and used daily on production codebases.

## Features

<sub>
🚧 = partial support. 🧩 = requires plugin. 💰 = paid tier.<br>
<sup>1</sup> Completion, hover, signature help, go-to-definition, find references, diagnostics, document symbols.<br>
<sup>2</sup> Auto-import, go-to implementation / type-definition, smart select, folding ranges, formatting, code lens, inlay hints, type hierarchy, document links.<br>
<sup>3</sup> Implement interface methods, extract method/function, extract/inline variable, generate constructor, generate getter/setter.<br>
<sup>4</sup> CakePHP, non-Composer WordPress, Symfony, Behat, PHPUnit, and Prophecy, and Twig.<br>
<sup>5</sup> Convert between arrow functions and closures, and switch statements to match expressions.<br>
Performance measured on a production codebase: 21K PHP files, 1.5M lines of code (vendor + application). Time to ready is CPU time consumed until full type intelligence is available on a cold start (first index); tools with a disk cache launch faster on subsequent starts.
</sub>

> **Want to verify?** Open [`examples/demo.php`](examples/demo.php) in your editor and trigger completion at the marked locations. It exercises every type intelligence feature in the table, including edge cases where tools diverge. For Laravel specifically, open [`examples/laravel/`](examples/laravel/) — a standalone project with real Eloquent models, config, routes, views, and translations that exercises Eloquent property resolution, query builder chaining, scopes, custom collections, and go-to-definition for config keys, route names, and translation strings.

## Context-Aware Intelligence

- **Smart PHPDoc completion.** `@throws` detects uncaught exceptions in the method body, `@param` pre-fills from the signature, and tags are filtered to context and never suggested twice.
- **Array shape inference.** Literal arrays offer key completion with no annotation. Nested shapes, spreads, and array functions like `array_map` preserve element types.
- **Closure parameter inference.** `$users->map(fn($u) => $u->name)` infers `$u` as `User` from the collection's generic context.
- **Conditional return types.** PHPStan-style conditional `@return` types resolve to the concrete branch at each call site.
- **Type aliases and shapes.** `@phpstan-type`, `@phpstan-import-type`, and `object{...}` shapes all resolve through to completions.
- **Laravel.** Eloquent relationships, scopes, accessors, casts, and Builder chains resolve end-to-end. Macros behave like real methods. Container strings like `app('cache')` resolve to the bound class, `auth()->user()` resolves to your configured model, and query string compleation on both relation and column names. Blade templates get completion, hover, go-to-definition, and diagnostics through virtual PHP preprocessing. No ide-helper or database access required.
- **Everything else you'd expect.** Generics, type narrowing, named arguments, destructuring, first-class callables, anonymous classes, `@deprecated` detection, and namespace segment drilling.

## Project Awareness

PHPantom understands Composer projects out of the box, but works without setup on non-Composer projects too:

- **Autoloader-accurate results.** Completions and go-to-definition only surface classes that Composer's autoloader can actually load, avoiding false positives from internal, inaccessible, or duplicate vendor classes. You see exactly what your application can use.
- **PSR-4 correctness.** Qucik fixes for when the namespace or class name does not match their PSR-4 path.
- **PSR-4 autoloading.** Resolves classes across files on demand.
- **Classmap and file autoloading.** `autoload_classmap.php` and `autoload_files.php`.
- **Embedded PHP stubs** from [phpstorm-stubs](https://github.com/JetBrains/phpstorm-stubs) bundled in the binary, no runtime downloads needed.
- **Drupal project support.** Detects Drupal projects via `composer.json`, resolves the web root, and indexes Drupal-specific directories and PHP extensions (`.module`, `.install`, `.theme`, etc.) with `.gitignore` bypassed so that Composer-managed core and contrib code is always available.
- **`require_once` discovery.** Functions from required files are available for completion.
- **Go-to-implementation.** Jump from an interface or abstract class to all concrete implementations. Scans open files, classmap, PSR-4 directories, and embedded stubs.

## Acknowledgements

PHPantom stands on the shoulders of:

- **[Mago](https://github.com/carthage-software/mago):** the PHP parser that powers all of PHPantom's AST analysis.
- **[PHPStan](https://phpstan.org/) and [Psalm](https://psalm.dev/):** for their pioneering work in PHP static analysis and shaping the type ecosystem. PHPantom builds on PHPStan-informed type experience, with full support for `@phpstan-*` annotations.
- **[JetBrains phpstorm-stubs](https://github.com/JetBrains/phpstorm-stubs):** type information for the entire PHP standard library, embedded directly into the binary.
- **[Phpactor](https://github.com/phpactor/phpactor):** the PHP language server whose comprehensive test suite and benchmark fixtures informed PHPantom's own test coverage. Many of PHPantom's type inference fixtures were adapted from Phpactor's reflection tests.
