Performance measured on a production codebase: 21K PHP files, 1.5M lines of code (vendor + application). Time to ready is CPU time consumed until full type intelligence is available on a cold start (first index); tools with a disk cache launch faster on subsequent starts.

> [!TIP]
> **Want to verify?** Open [`examples/php/`](examples/php/) in your editor and trigger completion at the marked locations in `completion.php`. It exercises every type intelligence feature in the table, including edge cases where tools diverge. Framework playgrounds live in [`examples/laravel/`](examples/laravel/) and [`examples/symfony/`](examples/symfony/).

## Context-Aware Intelligence

- **Smart PHPDoc completion.** `@throws` detects uncaught exceptions in the method body, `@param` pre-fills from the signature, and tags are filtered to context and never suggested twice.
- **Array shape inference.** Literal arrays offer key completion with no annotation. Nested shapes, spreads, and array functions like `array_map` preserve element types.
- **Closure parameter inference.** `$users->map(fn($u) => $u->name)` infers `$u` as `User` from the collection's generic context.
- **Conditional return types.** PHPStan-style conditional `@return` types resolve to the concrete branch at each call site.
- **Type aliases and shapes.** `@phpstan-type`, `@phpstan-import-type`, and `object{...}` shapes all resolve through to completions.
- **Laravel.** Eloquent relationships, scopes, accessors, casts, and Builder chains resolve end-to-end. Macros behave like real methods. Container strings like `app('cache')` resolve to the bound class, `auth()->user()` resolves to your configured model, authorization strings resolve to the gate definition or policy method that declares them, and query string compleation on both relation and column names. Blade templates get completion, hover, go-to-definition, and diagnostics through virtual PHP preprocessing. No ide-helper or database access required.
- **Symfony.** Container configuration, routes, Twig templates, translations, events, Messenger, forms, validation mappings, Doctrine metadata, and local configuration schemas participate in completion, navigation, references, rename, diagnostics, and code lenses across PHP, YAML, XML, XLIFF, and Twig.
- **Everything else you'd expect.** Generics, type narrowing, named arguments, destructuring, first-class callables, anonymous classes, `@deprecated` detection, and namespace segment drilling.

## Project Awareness

PHPantom understands Composer projects out of the box, but works without setup on non-Composer projects too:

- **Autoloader-accurate results.** Completions and go-to-definition only surface classes that Composer's autoloader can actually load, avoiding false positives from internal, inaccessible, or duplicate vendor classes. You see exactly what your application can use.
- **PSR-4 correctness.** Qucik fixes for when the namespace or class name does not match their PSR-4 path.
- **PSR-4 autoloading.** Resolves classes across files on demand.
- **Classmap and file autoloading.** `autoload_classmap.php` and `autoload_files.php`.
- **Embedded PHP stubs** from [phpstorm-stubs](https://github.com/JetBrains/phpstorm-stubs) bundled in the binary, no runtime downloads needed.
- **Drupal project support.** Detects Drupal projects via `composer.json`, resolves the web root, and indexes Drupal-specific directories and PHP extensions (`.module`, `.install`, `.theme`, etc.) with `.gitignore` bypassed so that Composer-managed core and contrib code is always available.
- **`require_once` discovery.** Functions from required files are available for completion.
- **Go-to-implementation.** Jump from an interface or abstract class to all concrete implementations. Scans open files, classmap, PSR-4 directories, and embedded stubs.
- **Workspace-wide diagnostics.** After startup, diagnostics run in the background across every file in the project, not just the ones you have open, so problems are already visible when you navigate to a file. Configured external tools (PHPStan, PHPCS, Mago) run project-wide too, once the background pass finishes. Both are deferred until after startup so they never slow down time to ready.

## Acknowledgements

PHPantom stands on the shoulders of:

- **[Mago](https://github.com/carthage-software/mago):** the PHP parser that powers all of PHPantom's AST analysis.
- **[PHPStan](https://phpstan.org/) and [Psalm](https://psalm.dev/):** for their pioneering work in PHP static analysis and shaping the type ecosystem. PHPantom builds on PHPStan-informed type experience, with full support for `@phpstan-*` annotations.
- **[JetBrains phpstorm-stubs](https://github.com/JetBrains/phpstorm-stubs):** type information for the entire PHP standard library, embedded directly into the binary.
- **[Phpactor](https://github.com/phpactor/phpactor):** the PHP language server whose comprehensive test suite and benchmark fixtures informed PHPantom's own test coverage. Many of PHPantom's type inference fixtures were adapted from Phpactor's reflection tests.
